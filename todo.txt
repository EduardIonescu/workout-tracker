TODO:
- Redirect user when they click on a specific exercise;

- They should be redirected to a page with the exercise's name as the title, 
input date, sets/reps and notes;

- Add set button; Delete added set button; Submit button;

TODO: 19.10.2021

- Show exercise history(pull the data from mongo and show it on the page with 
the exercise's name on the top)
- If the exercise has no history then display a message saying that

TODO: 20.10.2021

- Add delete / modify option for history
for delete: probably grab the data from mongo and modify it in node based on id
for modify: change the data based on id(might be too time consuming, if it is 
then leave it for later)
- Add those 2 inside a dropdown button

- Clear form fields on submit in AddSets and let the user know he submitted 

-- I left modify for later because it's dumb.

TODO: 20.10.2021 EXTRA

- Make a workout log page showing the exercises and their sets based on a day.
